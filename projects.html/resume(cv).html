                    This is a simple and clean portfolio website I built using just <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. 
                    It‚Äôs meant to act as my digital space where anyone can get to know me better ‚Äî   whether it‚Äôs my background, 
                    skills, or what I‚Äôve been up to.

                <p>
                    I‚Äôve used clean HTML structure and basic CSS for styling and layout.This project gave me hands-on experience with what I‚Äôve learned so far and helped me understand 
                    how everything comes together on a real website. It's just the beginning, and I‚Äôm looking forward to improving it as 
                    I learn more ‚Äî especially when I dive into JavaScript, and eventually add more interactivity and responsiveness.
