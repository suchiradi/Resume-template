                    This is a simple weather API (Application Programming Interface) made using <strong>Python and Flask</strong>. The main idea behind this project was to let users check the current temperature 
                    of any city just by typing the city name in the URL. It connects to the OpenWeatherMap API, fetches live weather data, and shows the 
                    temperature in Celsius.  It helped me understand how Flask works, how to use routes, and how to pull real data from the internet using APIs.

                        You can search the weather of any city by just typing it in the URL (like /weather/Delhi).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shows the temperature in Celsius after converting it from Kelvin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather data.

                    This project was a great way for me to learn how to work with APIs and how backend logic works using Flask. 
                    It‚Äôs not too complex, but it taught me a lot ‚Äî from routing to making API calls to handling JSON data.
